# -Loops-and-User-Input-in-Java
This Java program uses while and do-while loops for counting and user interaction. It counts from -10 to 0 by 1, from 1 to 20 by 3 with commas, and prompts the user to enter numbers until they input 99, tracking incorrect attempts. A great practice for loop structures and input handling.
